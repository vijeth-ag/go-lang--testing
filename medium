> go test

Go has in-built Testing package using import "testing"

Setup:
    - Test files need to have suffix _test.go, so that go test command will run all the files with _test.go prefix
    - In _test files Function name should be of the format Test<FunctionName>  for Ex. TestAddition, here Addition func is being tested

Running tests
    - Basic test can be run using "go test" command - prints pass/fail and time taken, if any fails prints it out
    - Verbose flag "go test -v" v for verbose, will run test with more detailed output, lists all testNames and time taken individually
    - we can run only a required test function using -run flag. 
        Example "go test -run=TestMultiplication" will only run TestMultiplication and not the whole _test file

    - Test Coverage
        + "go test -cover" will run tests and prints coverage in %
        + cover has more options to output to html etc
